# Problem to Solve
---
As a data engineer at NASA, you often spend your time cleaning meteorites—or at least the data they create.

You’ve been given a CSV file of historical meteorite landings here on Earth, of which there are quite a few! Your job is to import the data into a SQLite database, cleaning it up along the way. After you’re done, the database will be used in analyses by some of your fellow engineers

In import.sql, write a series of SQL (and SQLite) statements to import and clean the data from meteorites.csv into a table, meteorites, in a database called meteorites.db.

Within meteorites.db, the meteorites table should have the following columns:

Columns in the meteorites table
Keep in mind that not all columns in the CSV should end up in the final table!

To consider the data in the meteorites table clean, you should ensure…

1. Any empty values in meteorites.csv are represented by NULL in 
the meteorites table.
    - Keep in mind that the mass, year, lat, and long columns have empty values in the CSV.

2. All columns with decimal values (e.g., 70.4777) should be rounded to the nearest hundredths place (e.g., 70.4777 becomes 70.48).
    - Keep in mind that the mass, lat, and long columns have decimal values.

3. All meteorites with the nametype “Relict” are not included in the meteorites table.

4. The meteorites are sorted by year, oldest to newest, and then—if any two meteorites landed in the same year—by name, in alphabetical order.

5. You’ve updated the IDs of the meteorites from meteorites.csv, according to the order specified in #4.
    - The id of the meteorites should start at 1, beginning with the meteorite that landed in the oldest year and is the first in alphabetical order for that year.
